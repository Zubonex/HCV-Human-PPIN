Finding Hubs in a HCV-Human PPIN
#Ns5A-Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is an essential component of the HCV replication complex. The NS5a protein interacts with other key viral products (NS4B, NS5B, RNA) and host cell proteins (cyclophilin A, kinases, etc.) to regulate viral replication and assembly. The NS5A protein plays a critical role in the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which facilitates efficient viral replication. In addition to its role in HCV replication, the NS5A protein also contributes to HCV pathogenesis, modulation of cell signaling pathways, virus propagation and response to interferon via the interferon-alfa sensitivity determining region.The direct-acting antiviral agent class NS5A inhibitors target the NS5A protein.
