The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing pro [...] ","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left position=northeast outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false",,"https://string-db.org//images/Proteinpictures/pdb/5g/5gjq_b.png","stringdb","protein","MAAVSVYAPPVGGFSFDNCRRNAVLEADFAKRGYKLPKVRKTGTTIAGVVYKDGIVLGADTRATEGMVVADKNCSKIHFISPNIYCCGAGTAADTDMTTQLISSNLELHSLSTGRLPRVVTANRMLKQMLFRYQGYIGAALVLGGVDVTGPHLYSIYPHGSTDKLPYVTMGSGSLAAMAVFEDKFRPDMEEEEAKNLVSEAIAAGIFNDLGSGSNIDLCVISKNKLDFLRPYTVPNKKGTRLGRYRCEKGTTAVLTEKITPLEIEVLEETVQTMDTS","Homo sapiens","string:","4r67_I|5gjq_b|AF-Q99436","Tbio","Enzyme","2.385631","2.939378","2.22247","2.609306","2.729154","1.811128","2.797839","2.961101","3.039397","4.765875","4.795216","2.864004","4.555168","2.887938","1.764923","3.541996","2.489796","2.226944","2.302511","4.377223","0.30095238095238097"

Under normal conditions, BAX is largely cytosolic via constant retrotranslocation from mitochondria to the cytosol mediated by BCL2L1/Bcl-xL, which avoids accumulation of toxic BAX levels at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Under stress conditions, undergoes a conformation change that causes translocation to the mitochondrion membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c that then triggers apoptosis. Promotes activation of CASP3, and thereby apoptosis.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left position=northeast outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false",,"https://string-db.org//images/Proteinpictures/pdb/2k/2k7w_A.png","stringdb","protein","MDGSGEQPRGGGPTSSEQIMKTGALLLQGFIQDRAGRMGGEAPELALDPVPQDASTKKLSECLKRIGDELDSNMELQRMIAAVDTDSPREVFFRVAADMFSDGNFNWGRVVALFYFASKLVLKALCTKVPELIRTIMGWTLDFLRERLLGWIQDQGGWVRLLKPPHPHHRALTTAPAPPSLPPATPLGPWAFWSRSQWCPLPIFRSSDVVYNAFSLRV","Homo sapiens","string:","2k7w_A|3pk1_B|4bdu_A|5w5z_A|6xy6_P|AF-Q07812","Tchem","Other","3.346627","3.69905","2.732158","3.404531","2.968648","2.635732","3.643496","3.879527","3.665417","3.729722","3.731928","3.905882","4.759118","3.202052","2.506369","4.65976","3.43773","3.553256","2.963704","2.663223","0.0"
